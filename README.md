Part 4 (Tickets and Ticket Lifecycle)

Just practice creating, triaging, and solving tickets. I recommend watching the video to learn about triaging multiple tickets.

Ticket examples:

*Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7) [entire mobile/online banking system is down] -> SysAdmins

*Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) [accounting department needs adobe upgrade, broken]

*Sev-B/C (2 hours, business hours) [CFOâ€™s laptop seems a bit slow]
